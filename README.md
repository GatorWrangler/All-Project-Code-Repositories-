Welcome to River Mile!

River Mile is a unique android application that is designed to allow users to track personal usage statistics for whitewater rafting and kayaking. Users can track data including number of days spent on the water, number of miles paddled, swims and a breakdown of the difficulty that the user paddles at. All of this data is visible to the user and can easily be sorted by date, type of watercraft, and difficulty of run. Additionally, users can compare their statistics with other users to see and share data on runs for easy tracking. A global leaderboard will enable users to watch the top 5 users for every category. Users may also search for specific users by name to allow one on one comparisons. Users will input data on the unique sections of the river that they paddle and this data will be stored and accessible by all other users. This allows users to easily log their runs without having to input large amounts of data every time, and it allows for congruent data for all users on a given section. There are many applications in the whitewater community that are designed to track water levels, but none that allow users to keep track of their personal usage.
