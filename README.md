Welcome to River Mile!

River Mile is a unique android application that is designed to allow users to track personal usage statistics for whitewater rafting and kayaking. Users can track data including number of days spent on the water, number of miles paddled, swims and a breakdown of the difficulty that the user paddles at. All of this data is visible to the user and can easily be sorted by date, type of watercraft, and difficulty of run. Additionally, users can compare their statistics with other users to see and share data on runs for easy tracking. A global leaderboard will enable users to watch the top 5 users for every category. Users may also search for specific users by name to allow one on one comparisons. Users will input data on the unique sections of the river that they paddle and this data will be stored and accessible by all other users. This allows users to easily log their runs without having to input large amounts of data every time, and it allows for congruent data for all users on a given section. There are many applications in the whitewater community that are designed to track water levels, but none that allow users to keep track of their personal usage.

# Repo Structure

Its a little disorganized... 

On the home page of the repo, there are several zip files. These zip files include individuals contributions that were stored on local machines and never pushed to the master branch. The Contributions folder includes all of Rohit's various commits and his personal, local copy. 4th.zip includes the working demo that was shown for the inclass presentation. "log in and sign up" is a folder that contains the login page, signup page, forgot password page, and the database drivers needed for them to function. 

All-Project-Code-Repositories--master contains the majority of the code for the project that was being worked on collaboratively. Within this file is the folder River_Mile where all files to make the app are located. Individual pages can be found via /All-Project-Code-Repositories--master/River_Mile/app/src/main/res/layout/. All database files can be found via: /All-Project-Code-Repositories--master/River_Mile/app/src/main/java/com/brant/river_mile/.

# Building 
You must have android studio installed. Then download All-Project-Code-Repositories--master. From here, go to the Build Gradle file and build that. The app should now be ready to run on an emulator of your choosing.
